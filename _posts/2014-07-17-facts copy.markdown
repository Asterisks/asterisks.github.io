description: "<h3>Matt's Story</h3> “After nourishment, shelter and companionship, stories are the thing we need most in the world.” ― Philip Pullman<br /><br />

Matt strives to share his story every opportunity he presented. Speaking to kids and audiences of all ages in a variety of events, Matt is not only dedicated to helping childhood cancer victims, but also to empowering others to reach their full potential.   His message titled, “Tragedy to Opportunity” appeases audiences, building off the idea that everyone has a story and we need simply to search how we can use it to help others.<br /><br />
