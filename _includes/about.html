Following surgery and radiation treatments, Matt began collecting hats as a way to hide his baldness. As his hat collection grew, Matt began thinking of ways to reach out to other children undergoing cancer treatments. It became his dream to collect 1000 hats and use them to raise money for childhood cancer research.</p>
